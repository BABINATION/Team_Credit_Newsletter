                    AMP approval despite income complexity: Clients relied on rental and super income. Silvia leveraged Income Protection Payments and managed a tricky structure where AMP wouldn't accept OOP as security, so the equity was used to purchase OOP fully. The deal settled smoothly, and the clients were delighted.
                    <br><br>
                    Land loan success during bereavement leave: The client was on bereavement leave but had cleverly aligned Centrelink and annual leaves. Despite back-and-forth and near-loss of hope, Silvia pushed through and got the land loan settled.

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Our relatively new Credit Analysts are already making their mark. Sadina is quickly catching up with speed and delivering value to her broker team. She's secured approvals on complex foreign self-employed deals and even achieved a few one-shot approvals‚Äîa big milestone early on. Both Dikshyas have been consistent, confidently handling complex deals on their own, showing maturity and technical growth. The newest batch is also settling in fast and learning the ropes like pros. Shoutout to Smriti, Kristi, Anish, Elisha, Praish, and Pranisha‚Äîyour curiosity and adaptability are commendable! And none of this would be possible without the support of the general credit team. Huge appreciation to everyone especially Prajwal and Sulav for handling workloads, supporting dedicated teams in need, coaching, guiding, and being strong anchors for the newcomers.
